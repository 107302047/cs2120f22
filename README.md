# Boot Up

- Install Git on your  machine
- Install Docker Desktop on your machine (Windows, OSX)
- Install VSCode on your machine
- Fork our repo in GitHub to create your own copy (you will need a GitHub account, available free)
- Clone your new fork of our repo to a local directory (dir) on your machine
- Run VSCode to open on that directory (e.g., cd into directory then run "code .")
- At this point, the automated Docker container build process should kick off. Let it go.
- When it's done, open terminal in VSCode (it will now be a terminal into the container)
- Run leanproject build in the top-level directory using this terminal
- Confirm that test file in the test directory works as indicated by the comments inside it

Push frequently to GitHub to backup containerized working repo to remote machine
